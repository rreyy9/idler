# Stone Mining System Documentation

## Overview

We developed a comprehensive stone mining system that integrates seamlessly with our existing Phaser 3 tick-based game. The system introduces resource collection mechanics (stone and iron) with a clickable mining interface that operates on the same 1.25-second tick intervals as the core game system.

## Core Components

### 1. ResourceManager (js/systems/ResourceManager.js)

**Purpose**: Manages stone and iron collection with visual display

**Key Features:**
- Tracks stone and iron quantities
- Live resource display panel (top-left of screen)
- Save/load integration for persistent resource counts
- Emoji-based resource icons for visual clarity

**Methods:**
```javascript
addResource(type, amount)    // Add stone or iron
getResource(type)           // Get current amount
getSaveData()              // Export for saving
loadSaveData(data)         // Import from save
```

**Visual Display:**
```
Resources:
ðŸª¨ Stone: 125
âš¡ Iron: 15
```

### 2. StoneMiningSystem (js/systems/StoneMiningSystem.js)

**Purpose**: Handles mining mechanics and visual feedback

**Key Features:**
- Clickable mine button (gray rectangle with "ðŸª¨ MINE" text)
- Toggle mining on/off functionality
- Visual state feedback (cyan glow when active)
- Tick-based mining integration
- Rarity-based reward calculation
- Mining effect animations
- Offline mining simulation

**Button States:**
- **Inactive**: Gray button, white text, "Click to start mining"
- **Active**: Cyan glow, cyan text, "Mining active! Wait for ticks..."
- **Mining Effects**: Button flashes different colors based on mining rarity

**Mining Integration:**
- Hooks into existing tick system via method override
- Processes mining rewards on each tick when active
- Uses same random values as tick system for consistency

### 3. Enhanced TickSystem (js/systems/TickSystem.js)

**Purpose**: Core timing system now integrated with mining

**New Responsibilities:**
- Initialize ResourceManager and StoneMiningSystem
- Include mining data in save/load operations
- Simulate offline mining during batch processing
- Coordinate between tick events and mining rewards

**Integration Points:**
```javascript
setupSystems()           // Initialize mining systems
simulateOfflineTick()    // Include mining in offline simulation
saveGame()              // Save mining state and resources
loadSaveData()          // Load mining systems data
```

## Mining Mechanics

### Resource Rewards Per Tick

| Tick Rarity | Probability | Stone Gained | Iron Gained | Visual Effect |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Normal      | 40%         | 1            | 0           | Green flash   |
| Common      | 30%         | 2            | 0           | Cyan flash    |
| Uncommon    | 20%         | 3            | 1           | Yellow flash  |
| Rare        | 10%         | 5            | 3           | Magenta flash |

### Special Bonuses

**Milestone Rewards (Every 10th Tick):**
- +2 additional stone
- +1 additional iron
- Works both online and offline

**Visual Feedback:**
- Button flashes appropriate color during mining
- Status text updates with recent gains
- Brief messages appear showing mining results
- Message effects fade out over 2 seconds

```

## Configuration System

### GameConfig.js - Mining Section

```javascript
MINING: {
    MILESTONE_INTERVAL: 10,        // Every 10th tick bonus
    EFFECT_DURATION: 300,          // Visual effect duration (ms)
    MESSAGE_FADE_DURATION: 2000,   // Message fade time (ms)
    
    REWARDS: {
        BASE_STONE: 1,             // Normal tick
        COMMON_STONE: 2,           // Common tick
        UNCOMMON_STONE: 3,         // Uncommon tick  
        RARE_STONE: 5,             // Rare tick
        UNCOMMON_IRON: 1,          // Uncommon iron
        RARE_IRON: 3,              // Rare iron
        MILESTONE_STONE: 2,        // Milestone bonus
        MILESTONE_IRON: 1          // Milestone bonus
    }
}
```

### Visual Configuration

**Colors:**
- **Button Active**: Cyan glow (#00ffff)
- **Button Inactive**: Gray (#666666)
- **Mining Effects**: Rarity-based color flashing
- **Resource Display**: White text on black background

**Positioning:**
- **Mine Button**: Top-right (600, 200)
- **Resource Display**: Top-left (20, 250)
- **Status Text**: Below mine button (600, 250)

## Save System Integration

### Save Data Structure

```javascript
{
    tickCount: 1250,
    randomActions: [...],
    lastTickTime: 1699123456789,
    lastSaveTime: 1699123456789,
    gameVersion: "1.0.0",
    
    // New mining data
    resources: {
        stone: 125,
        iron: 15
    },
    stoneMining: {
        isActive: true
    }
}
```

### Save Triggers

- **Automatic**: Every 5 ticks (same as existing system)
- **Browser close**: `beforeunload` event
- **Manual**: Can be triggered programmatically

### Data Persistence

- **Resources**: Stone and iron counts persist across sessions
- **Mining State**: Button remembers if mining was active
- **Integration**: Uses existing SaveManager infrastructure

## Offline Progression

### Complete Offline Support

The mining system provides **full offline progression** with the same mechanics as online play:

**Offline Process:**
1. **Save mining state** when browser closes
2. **Calculate missed time** when returning
3. **Simulate each missed tick** individually
4. **Apply mining rewards** if mining was active
5. **Show progress bar** during batch processing
6. **Display welcome back summary**

**Offline Mining Logic:**
```javascript
simulateMiningTick(randomValue, tickCount) {
    // Uses identical logic to online mining
    // Same rarity calculations
    // Same milestone bonuses
    // Same resource rewards
}
```

**Features Preserved Offline:**
- âœ… **Exact same rewards** - No shortcuts or approximations
- âœ… **Rarity system** - Rare ticks still give bonus iron
- âœ… **Milestone bonuses** - Every 10th tick extras apply
- âœ… **Fair progression** - No offline advantages/disadvantages

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Batch processing** - Handles long offline periods efficiently
- **Progress feedback** - Visual progress bar during simulation
- **Memory efficient** - No data accumulation during simulation

## User Experience

3. **Watch resources** - Stone and iron counts increase each tick
4. **Observe effects** - Button flashes colors based on mining luck
5. **Leave active** - Close browser with mining on for offline progression

### Visual Feedback System
